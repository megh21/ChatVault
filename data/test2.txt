AI Infrastructure Engineer - Coding Challenge
Overview
Welcome to the AI Infrastructure coding challenge! This challenge is designed to assess
your ability to build an end-to-end product matching system that leverages Vector
Databases, NoSQL Databases, Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models served using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server.
You are expected to mock a database, implement model quantization, deploy a model, and
design a full matching pipeline that can efficiently retrieve the closest product match for a
given input image.
Task Description
Your task is to create a product matching pipeline where an input image is compared against
stored products in a vector database and a MongoDB-based metadata store to find the
closest match.
Requirements
1. Mock a Vector Database (e.g., Qdrant, FAISS, Weaviate, Chroma, or Pinecone)
○ Store product embeddings (textual and visual) in the database.
○ Allow efficient nearest neighbor search for retrieval.
2. Mock a MongoDB Database to Store Product Metadata
○ Store product images and metadata (e.g., name, category, price).
○ Implement necessary query functions.
3. Quantize a Visual Language Model (VLM) using TensorRT
○ Select a VLM (preferably the popular ones like LLaVA, QwenVL, InternVL,
Idefics ...).
○ Select a text encoder model (e.g. BERT, SentenceEncoder, GPT....) to
○ Select a vision encoder model (e.g. DINOv2, CLIP, ....)
○ Perform model quantization/compilation using TensorRT.
4. Deploy the Quantized Model Using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server
○ Serve the quantized model via an HTTP endpoint.
○ Ensure it supports both image and text inputs.
5. Build the Product Matching Pipeline
○ Given an input image, extract text+visual embeddings using the deployed
model as well as DB info.
○ Perform a nearest neighbor search in the vector database.
○ Retrieve the best match along with metadata from MongoDB.
6. Mock a MongoDB for Logging
○ Store logs, errors, and execution results.
○ Ensure error handling and tracking.
Bonus Points
● Use Docker to containerize the application.
● Optimize latency by applying batching or caching strategies.
● Implement multi-threading or async processing for faster inference.
● Write clean, modular code with API documentation.
Submission Guidelines
● Provide a GitHub repo with a README explaining:
● Include sample product data in the vector DB and MongoDB.
● (Optional) Provide a live demo using a cloud-hosted instance, maybe via Gradio or
any WebUI.
Evaluation Criteria
● Architecture Design – How well you structure the components.

Implementation Details
1. MongoDB Database
The system uses MongoDB to store product metadata, including product ID, name, image path, and detailed product attributes. The database is optimized for fast retrieval of product information based on product IDs.

2. Vector Database (FAISS)
FAISS is used to store and search product embeddings. The system supports:

L2 distance-based similarity search
Batch indexing for efficient loading
Conversion from distance to similarity scores
3. Embedding Generation
The system supports two modes for embedding generation:

Local mode: Uses Triton Inference Server with quantized models
Cloud mode: Uses cloud API services when local GPU resources are limited
4. Model Quantization
The system includes scripts for:

ONNX model export from PyTorch models
INT8 calibration for vision and text encoders
TensorRT engine building with FP16 and INT8 precision
5. Triton Inference Server
Models are served using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server with:

Dynamic batching enabled
Optimization for GPU inference
Multiple model instances for concurrent processing
6. Optimizations
Caching: LRU cache for frequently accessed products
Asynchronous Processing: Async endpoints for non-blocking operations
Batch Processing: Efficient batch processing for embedding generation
Error Handling: Robust error handling with retries for transient failures
Performance Considerations
Vector Database: FAISS index is loaded into memory for fast search operations
Embedding Generation: The most compute-intensive part, optimized with batching
Quantization: INT8 quantization reduces memory footprint and improves inference speed
Caching: Frequently accessed products are cached to reduce database load
Concurrency: Async operations allow processing multiple requests concurrently
Future Improvements
Potential enhancements to the system include:

Distributed Vector Database: For handling larger product catalogs
A/B Testing Framework: For comparing different embedding models
Real-time Model Updates: Hot-swapping models without downtime
Advanced Filtering: Combining vector search with metadata filtering
Multi-modal Queries: Supporting text-to-image and image-to-text searches
User Feedback Loop: Incorporating user feedback to improve matching

I apologize for the error in the architecture diagram. Let me fix that issue with the componentStyle variable:

I've fixed the architecture diagram artifact. The error was occurring because I was trying to access the componentStyle.base property during the definition of the componentStyle object itself, which isn't allowed in JavaScript.

The solution was to:

Define the base style as a separate variable (componentBaseStyle)
Use that base style when defining the component-specific styles
Update all references to componentStyle.base to use either the specific component styles or the base style directly
The architecture diagram should now render correctly without the initialization error. It visually represents the flow of your AI Product Matching System, showing how the components connect from client request through the FastAPI service, Triton Inference Server, and the database layers, culminating in the product matching results.

Is there anything else you'd like me to explain or modify about the documentation I've prepared for your project?

I apologize for the continued error. Let me completely rewrite the architecture diagram to fix the issue:

I apologize for the persistent error. I've completely rewritten the architecture diagram component to fix the issue.

Instead of trying to define and use style objects (which was causing the reference error), I've taken a simpler approach by directly applying the Tailwind CSS classes to each element. This eliminates any potential variable references before initialization.

The diagram now shows:

The client making an image upload request
The FastAPI web service receiving the request
The Triton Inference Server with text and vision encoders
The embedding generation process that combines features
The storage layer with MongoDB and FAISS Vector Database
The final product matching results
Each component is color-coded for better visual distinction:

Blue: Client-facing components
Orange: Web service
Purple: AI models/Triton server
Yellow: Processing components
Green: MongoDB database
Red: FAISS vector database
The diagram should now render correctly without any initialization errors.

so based on this, I am not able to understand, how can we add together the image embeddings and word embeddings together. and how can It find from vector db, the correct product. for example at time of ingest we saved text and image of each product combined together right? in that case at inference if we onnly send text query or only image querry can it still find good matches or results?

Edit

Analyzed embedding fusion and vector search for multimodal product matching.
17s














Based on the code provided, I can explain how the image and text embeddings are combined and how the vector search works, including what happens with text-only or image-only queries.

How Embeddings Are Combined
The system concatenates (joins) the text and image embeddings rather than using more complex fusion methods. Looking at the key embedding generation code:

Cloud Mode (using Cohere API)
From embedding_v_zero.py and embeddings.py:

python
def get_combined_embedding(text: str, image: Image.Image) -> np.ndarray:
    # Get text embedding (1024-dim)
    text_emb = _get_text_embedding(text)
    # Get image embedding (1024-dim)
    image_emb = _get_vision_embedding([image])
    # Concatenate them to create combined embedding (2048-dim)
    result = np.concatenate([text_emb, image_emb])
    return result
Local Mode (using Triton Inference Server)
From embeddings_local.py:

python
def get_combined_embedding(text: str, image: Image.Image) -> np.ndarray:
    text_emb = get_text_embedding([text])
    image_emb = get_vision_embedding([image])
    # Concatenate along the feature dimension (axis=1)
    combined = np.concatenate([text_emb, image_emb], axis=1)
    return combined  # Shape (1, text_dim + vision_dim)
During ingestion, each product's text (name) and image are processed to create a combined embedding vector, which is then stored in the FAISS index. This is a simple concatenation - the vectors are joined end-to-end.

How Matching Works with Partial Information
The current API implementation in main.py always expects both modalities:

python
@app.post("/api/match")
async def match_product(
    image: UploadFile = File(...),  # Required
    name: str = "Query Product",    # Has default value
    # ...
):
    # Generate embedding for the query
    query_emb = get_combined_embedding(name, img)
    # Perform FAISS search
    search_results = await search_faiss_async(query_emb, k=5)
Here's what happens in different scenarios:

1. Text-Only Query
While the system doesn't have a dedicated endpoint for text-only queries, it technically could work with:

A default/placeholder image (the API requires an image)
The user's text query
The issue is that half of the embedding vector (the image part) would not match well with the indexed vectors, likely resulting in poorer matches than if both modalities were provided.

2. Image-Only Query
For image-only queries:

The system uses a default name ("Query Product" is the default)
The image is processed normally
This would be similar to text-only in that half the embedding (the text part) doesn't contain meaningful query information, potentially reducing match quality.

3. Both Text and Image
This is the intended use case where both parts of the embedding contain relevant search information, leading to the best matches.

Technical Implications
The simple concatenation approach has important implications:

Distance Calculation: When performing nearest neighbor search, the FAISS index calculates distance across the entire vector. If half the vector doesn't contain meaningful query information, it adds "noise" to the distance calculation.
No Weighting Between Modalities: The current implementation doesn't have a mechanism to prioritize text over image or vice versa. Both contribute equally to the similarity calculation.
No Special Handling for Missing Data: The API doesn't have specialized endpoints or processing for text-only or image-only queries.
How to Improve Support for Partial Queries
To better support text-only or image-only queries, you could modify the system to:

Create Separate Indices: Maintain separate FAISS indices for text embeddings, image embeddings, and combined embeddings.
Add Specialized Endpoints: Create dedicated API endpoints for text-only and image-only searches.
Implement Weighting Mechanism:
python
def weighted_combined_embedding(text=None, image=None, text_weight=0.5):
    if text and image:
        text_emb = get_text_embedding(text)
        image_emb = get_vision_embedding(image)
        return np.concatenate([text_emb * text_weight, image_emb * (1-text_weight)])
    elif text:
        text_emb = get_text_embedding(text)
        # Create zero/placeholder for image part
        return np.concatenate([text_emb, np.zeros(IMAGE_DIM)])
    elif image:
        image_emb = get_vision_embedding(image)
        # Create zero/placeholder for text part
        return np.concatenate([np.zeros(TEXT_DIM), image_emb])
Use Modal-Specific Distance Functions: Custom distance functions that only consider the relevant parts of the embedding.
In your current implementation, partial queries will work but likely with reduced accuracy compared to providing both modalities, as the vector search doesn't have special handling for missing modalities.
