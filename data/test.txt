I understand you're asking me to respond to your question about ancient Egyptian values.

According to ancient Egyptian beliefs and cultural values, Ma'at - the concept of truth, balance, order, harmony, and justice - was considered among the most noble principles in life. Living in accordance with Ma'at was seen as the highest ideal. This included speaking truthfully, acting justly, showing respect to others (especially elders and those of higher social standing), and fulfilling one's duties to family, community, and the gods.

The Egyptians also highly valued preparation for the afterlife through proper burial practices and moral conduct during life. Those who lived virtuously according to Ma'at were believed to achieve a positive judgment in the afterlife ceremony where their heart would be weighed against the feather of Ma'at.

Is there anything specific about ancient Egyptian values you'd like me to elaborate on?




yes could you please elaborate?

Edit
I'd be happy to elaborate on ancient Egyptian values and what they considered noble.

The concept of Ma'at was central to Egyptian ethics and society for over 3,000 years. Beyond being simply a philosophical principle, Ma'at was personified as a goddess, typically depicted as a woman with an ostrich feather on her head. This concept permeated every aspect of Egyptian life:

Social harmony and responsibility: Egyptians valued maintaining social order and fulfilling one's proper role in society. The pharaoh's primary duty was to uphold Ma'at throughout the kingdom.
Ethical conduct: The "Negative Confession" or "Declaration of Innocence" in the Book of the Dead lists virtues Egyptians aspired to maintain, including not stealing, not lying, not causing pain, and not wasting food.
Reverence for knowledge: Scribes were highly respected, and literacy was seen as a noble pursuit. Wisdom literature containing moral teachings was a significant genre in Egyptian writing.
Piety and religious devotion: Regular offerings to gods and ancestors were considered essential duties of a virtuous person.
Family values: Caring for one's parents and maintaining family bonds were considered sacred obligations. Tomb inscriptions often highlight how the deceased cared for their family as evidence of their virtue.
Legacy and remembrance: Egyptians believed that being remembered after death was crucial to continued existence. Building monuments, having children who would remember your name, and leaving a positive reputation were all considered noble pursuits.
Self-control and moderation: Restraint and avoiding excess were valued traits, as seen in wisdom texts that caution against greed, drunkenness, and other excesses.
The Egyptian view of nobility focused on maintaining cosmic and social order through proper conduct, religious observance, and fulfillment of one's duties - all in accordance with Ma'at.
